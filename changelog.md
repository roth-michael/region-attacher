# Region Attacher Changelog

## Version 1.9.0
- Added improved PF2e support (thanks JamzTheMan!)
- Removed all jQuery use
- First pass at V13 compatibility

## Version 1.8.0
- Added support for SWADE system (4.4.0+) (thanks ddbrown30/TheChemist!)

## Version 1.7.0
- Added support for inline template links in pf2e (thanks Rowiz49!)
- Fixed a pf2e bug introduced in 1.6.2 (thanks Rowiz49!)

## Version 1.6.2
- Fixed a bug in dnd5e where regions weren't properly created for consumables which were destroyed by the time the measured template was placed

## Version 1.6.1
- Fixed a bug where the "Attach Region" checkbox and "Configure Region" button were accessible in a locked compendium

## Version 1.6.0
- Added compatibility with dnd5e v4.x
    - In 4.x, region attacher functionality is configured per-activity, not per-item; see the Activation tab, Targeting subtab when an area is selected
    - Should still remain compatible with 3.x
- Fixed a bug where template-attached regions would get "stuck" until a refresh

## Version 1.5.1
- _Actually_ fixed the aforementioned bug

## Version 1.5.0
- Added compatibility with PF2e item sheets similar to dnd5e's functionality
- Fixed a bug where regions couldn't be attached to existing Templates

## Version 1.4.4
- Fixed the wrong region uuid being present on a just-created template
- Minor logic change to marginally improve performance
- Fixed a bug where build-a-bonus would throw an error when opening modified region-attacher region config windows
- _Actually_ added pt-BR translation (thanks again Kharmans)

## Version 1.4.3
- Translation updates (thanks Kharmans)
    - Now includes pt-BR translation

## Version 1.4.2
- Added `itemUuid` and `actorUuid` flags on regions created via an item's template

## Version 1.4.1
- Fixed broken Measured Template config

## Version 1.4.0
- Fixed regions to still live-update for templates as long as the GM isn't dragging something on the canvas - this should allow regins to "stick to" moving tokens (if a template is attached to a token)
- Measured Template config improvements:
    - Added compatibility for modules which add tabs to config
    - Fixed bug where pressing "Configure Region" in config would close the config
    - Clicking "Attach Region" checkbox in config now immediately updates the template, so you can attach & configure without having to hit "Update Measured Template"
- Clicking "Attach Region" checkbox in Tile config no longer resets the active tab

## Version 1.3.0
- Got rid of the "live-preview" of regions moving while templates/tiles were being dragged or resized - this caused some visual bugs & could cause unintended interactions on the scene

## Version 1.2.0
- Should now be system agnostic (though with extra functionality for dnd5e)
- MeasuredTemplate config now has an added toggle for enabling region attachment & configuring the attached region

## Version 1.1.0
- First pass at attaching regions to tiles; currently only supported after tile is created
    - Currently when dragging a tile to change its size, there's some visual flickering, I hope to remedy that at some point
- Changed region update code to only update once every 100ms at most, which should reduce any performance hit
    - This change assumes only one region should be updating within a given 100ms window, so won't fully work for dragging multiple tiles with regions attached, for instance; in this case, moving each tile a small amount and back after such a multi-drag will update them each in turn

## Version 1.0.2
- Fixed bug introduced in last bugfix where region would never update

## Version 1.0.1
- Fixed feedback loop that caused region to re-update whenever associated template was hovered

## Version 1.0.0
- Added setting for the GM to allow players the see the checkbox & configuration button on their item sheets
    - If enabled, the player will still not be able to configure the region, but they'll be able to toggle whether it's created
- Added setting for devault visibility of item-created regions (mirroring the dropdown available on a full scene region configuration window)
- Scene regions should now stick more accurately to templates in the instance that they are rotated without moving their position

## Version 0.4.0
- Region Configuration Menu added; now if attaching a Scene Region to an item-created template, can pre-configure its behaviors in the item sheet
    - For now, this is restricted only to GMs, as a temporary region is created in the background while the behaviors are pre-configured

## Version 0.3.1
- Added tidy5e integration

## Version 0.3.0
- Added changelog
- Ensured only GM will run code in hooks
